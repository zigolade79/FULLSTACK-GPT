Haikus often focus on nature, seasons, or emotions, and aim to capture a moment or feeling in a concise and evocative way. The brevity of haikus encourages readers to pause and reflect on the imagery and emotions conveyed in just a few words. Traditional haikus also include a kigo, or seasonal reference, which helps to set the scene and create a sense of atmosphere. Overall, haikus are a beautiful and contemplative form of poetry that can evoke a sense of mindfulness and connection to the natural world."
